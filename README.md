# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using Machine Learning classification techniques. The dataset includes health-related attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical features.

📌 Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values.

Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, chest pain type).

Performed feature scaling for optimized model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions and correlations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Identified key health indicators influencing heart disease risk.

Modeling

Trained a classification model to predict heart disease presence.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Results

The model achieved strong predictive accuracy in classifying patients with and without heart disease, showing the usefulness of machine learning in healthcare analytics.
